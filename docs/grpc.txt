The following protobuf definition is used:

message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    int32 longitude = 2;
    int32 latitude = 3;
}

To test the API, first follow the README instructions to set up the app using kubernetes. After, all the pods are running
from the location `nd064-c2-message-passing-projects-starter/modules/location_producer` it is possible to run a simple command to
create a location.
First install the defined requirements in requirements.txt and then run

```
python writer_test.py
```

It will create the following location message:

location = location_pb2.LocationMessage(
    person_id=6,
    latitude=200,
    longitude=300

)
