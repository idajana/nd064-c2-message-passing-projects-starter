Achitecture Design

The project was already implemented using REST APIs, this is an important when considering costs and human resources for implementing changes.
Therefore, for parts of the project which include the frontend API calls we keep the REST API infrastrucure. It is widely adopted and we don't require high througphut.

For sending location data from the mobile devices we need a higher throughput. Since the can be many requests when a lot of users are on the same event. For that reason we adopted gRPC. Overall, gRPC provides more structure and important - more speed.
Additionally, we added a message queue using Kafka, for similar reasons as before. The expected load is expected to be high and such message queues are a good way to ensure that there is no loss of data and the messages can be processed in a smarter, parallel way.
